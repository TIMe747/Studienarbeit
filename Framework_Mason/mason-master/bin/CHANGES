Version 1.5.1:
	- Fixed exceptions in ShapeFileImporter.java (Thanks to Matt L.
	  Miller hzmiller@ucdavis.edu, and to Luis de Sousa for patches
	  for ensuring the demoes worked with the new exception changes.)
	- Added removeGeometry() (Thanks to Matt L. Miller
          hzmiller@ucdavis.edu and Luís de Sousa
          <luis.a.de.sousa@gmail.com>)
	- Added support for ESRI Shape file PointZ types (though not
          yet for LineZ nor PolygonZ yet) (Thanks to Luís de Sousa
          <luis.a.de.sousa@gmail.com> for suppyling sample data with Z
          types)
	- ArcInfoASCGridImporter.read() now exits if valid input is
          prematurely exhausted (Thanks to Luís de Sousa
          <luis.a.de.sousa@gmail.com> for bug report)
        - Performance improvement to silly peds demo (Thanks to Sean
          Luke <sean@cs.gmu.edu>)

Version 1.5:
	- Bug fixes with regards to clipping window in
          GeomVectorFieldPortrayal
	- GeomVectorField now more consistently uses MasonGeometry
          instead of JTS Geometry in interface
	- Eliminated 3rd part dependency for sickStudents demo
	- Added ability to update spatial index to GeomVectorField for
          dynamic fields (i.e., fields with moving geometry)
	- GeomVectorField.getObjectsWithinDistance() now properly does
          second pass of objects returned from spatial index
	- MasonGeometry toString() now returns meaningful geometry
          information
	- Added GeoMason Cookbook LaTeX/PDF in docs
	- Makefile by default now makes demos, too, instead of just
          src jar
	- Minor bug fixes

Version 1.4.1:
	- Fixed bug in GeomGridField.toPoint() where Y axis was
          inverted.
	- Minor fix to WaterWorld where Java RNG was used instead of
          SimState.random

Version 1.4:

	- Grid and vector layer exporters available
	  - ArcInfoASCGridExporter
	  - ShapeFileExporter
	- IO classes simplified; now use static write() calls
	- MasonGeometry attributes simpler to use
	- Bug fixes
	- Demo data directories now under respective source directories
	- Minor code clean-ups
	- Tweaks to demos to make them compatible with new charting
